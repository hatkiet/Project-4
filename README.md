# Project Source:
Dataset and APIs:
1.	NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data:
https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
Project Questions:
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	What are the key features in the NYC Taxi Trip Data?
o	How is the data distributed across different time periods (e.g., days of the week, months)?
o	What are the trends or patterns in taxi trip volumes over time?
o	Is there any correlation between taxi trip durations and other variables (e.g., distance, time of day)?
2.	Interactive Visualizations:
o	How can we visualize the geographical distribution of taxi pickups and drop-offs in NYC using Folium?
o	Are there any specific areas or neighborhoods that exhibit high taxi demand?
o	Can we visualize the temporal patterns of taxi trips throughout the day or week using interactive plots?
3.	Machine Learning Models:
o	How can we predict taxi demand for future time periods using machine learning?
o	Which features are most important for predicting taxi demand?
o	What machine learning algorithms are suitable for this prediction task (e.g., regression, time series forecasting, neural networks)?
o	Can we optimize the prediction model to improve accuracy and performance?
4.	User Interaction:
o	How can we create drop-down menus or interactive widgets for users to explore the data and prediction results?
o	What features or functionalities would enhance the user experience of the taxi trip analysis tool?
5.	Advanced Techniques:
o	How can we implement a neural network for predicting taxi demand?
o	What are the advantages and challenges of using neural networks for this prediction task?
o	Can we compare the performance of neural networks with traditional machine learning models?
