# Machine Learning Heart Attack

![Screenshot 2024-06-17 at 00 04 18](https://github.com/hatkiet/Project_4/assets/154283864/8b2c5940-9764-4c15-ba20-691b1b719c75)

## Project Description: 

Use 2022 CDC BRFSS survey dataset to respondents group, analyze and evaluate for patterns. We will develop Machine Learning models based off demographic information, risk factors along with additonal health information, to best develop a prediction of heart attack risks for indviduals. A machine learning model that could predict an individualâ€™s risk of heart attack would be highly beneficial as healthcare resources can be allocated more effectively and early prevention will significantly reduce healthcare costs.

For future implementations of this model, an individual can input their general health information, including Age, Physical Activity, Smoking, BMI, and more, and the model will determine whether the individual is at high or low risk of heart attack. If high risk, the platform will provide a list of next steps, including a medical consultation, lifestyle changes, regular monitoring of health indicators, and potential treatments. This will lead to behavioural changes and more informed patients.
