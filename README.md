# Machine Learning Heart Disease

# Project 4 Proposal: Heart Disease

## Project Description: 

Use Heart Disease Data to segment customers based on demographics and make predictions. We will be forming clusters based on demographics information and using this to gather valuable insights and making prediction/forecasting. 

### Technologies: python, machine learning, tableau, sql, pandas

### Database: from Kaggle 

### Question we are interested in: 

[1] 

### Tasks: 

[1] Data Emgineering: cleaning, merging datasets 
[2] Machine Learning: Unsupervised learning, PCA 
[3] Visualizations will be made with HTML DropDown Menu and a story.

### Group Members and tasks each will do: 

All members look for datasets, ETL, perform machine learning algorithms once data is prepared  Pandas, data analysis, Tableau, presentation, data analysis

## TECHNICAL STEPS:

### (i) Data Engineering Steps: 

1. Load the dataset / read csv
2. Check the missing values / filter / clean
3. Insight into the Dataset: Dataset describe
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Data Visualization / Plotting the data
6. Export the output/dataframe 
7. Data Processing -Finding the correlation among features



### (ii) Machine Learning: 

1. Split data into features (X) and target variable (y)
2. Training Model
3. Standard scaler module (Neural Network Modeling)
4. Kmeans algorithm for clusters
5. PCA components for clusters
6. Sub clusters
7. PCA for sub clusters


### (iii) HTML Dropdown Menu:
1. Visualizations of machine learning outcomes
2. Presentation stories in HTML
