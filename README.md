## Project-4

# Machine Learning Obesity/Heart Disease/Brain/etc. Datasets

## Project 4 Proposal: Obesity/Heart Disease/Brain Datasets

## Project Description: 

Use Obesity/Heart Disease/Brain, etc. Datasets to segment customers based on demographics and make  predictions. We will be forming clusters based on demographics information and using this to gather valuable insights and making prediction/forecasting... 

### Technologies: python, machine learning, tableau, sql, pandas

### Database: from Kaggle 

### Question we are interested in: 

[1]

[2]

[3]


### Tasks: 

[1] Data Emgineering: cleaning, merging datasets 
[2] Machine Learning: Unsupervised learning, PCA 
[3] Visualizations will be made with Tableau, having several dashboards and a story.

### Group Members and proposed tasks each will do: 

* **Fara Naghavi** -  look for datasets, ETL, perform machine learning algorithms once data is prepared, Pandas, data analysis, Tableau, presentation, data analysis, data engineering tableau dashboard/story

* **Harrison Lee** - look for datasets, ETL, perform machine learning algorithms once data is prepared  Pandas, data analysis, Tableau, presentation, data analysis, data engineering tableau dashboard/story

* **Kiet Hoang**  - look for datasets, ETL, perform machine learning algorithms once data is prepared, Pandas, data analysis, Tableau, presentation, data analysis, data engineering tableau dashboard/story


## Data Engineering Steps: 

1. Load the dataset / read csv
2. Check the missing values / filter / clean
3. Insight into the Dataset: Dataset describe
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Data Visualization / Plotting the data
6. Export the output/dataframe 
7. Data Processing -Finding the correlation among features
8. Split data into features (X) and target variable (y)


## Machine Learning: 

1. Training Model
2. Standard scaler module
3. Kmeans algorithm for clusters
4. PCA components for clusters
5. Sub clusters
6. PCA for sub clusters


## Tableau:
1. Visualizations of machine learning outcomes
2. Presentation stories in Tableau
