# Machine Learning Obesity/Heart Disease/Brain Datasets

# Project 4 Proposal: Obesity/Heart Disease/Brain Datasets

## Project Description: 

Use Obesity/Heart Disease Data to segment customers based on demographics and make  predictions. We will be forming clusters based on demographics information and using this to gather valuable insights and making prediction/forecasting. 

### Technologies: python, machine learning, tableau, sql, pandas

### Database: from Kaggle 

### Question we are interested in: 

[1] What was the change in price of the stock overtime?

[2] What was the average price (in 10 days, 20 days, 30 days) of the various stocks?

[3] What was the daily return of the stock on average?

[4] What was the correlation between different stocks closing prices? Correlation between the stocks' daily return values

[5] How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?

[6] Predicting the closing price stock price of an particular stock

### Tasks: 

[1] Data Emgineering: cleaning, merging datasets 
[2] Machine Learning: Unsupervised learning, PCA 
[3] Visualizations will be made with Tableau, having several dashboards and a story.

### Group Members and tasks each will do: 

All members look for datasets, ETL, perform machine learning algorithms once data is prepared  Pandas, data analysis, Tableau, presentation, data analysis

## TECHNICAL STEPS:

### (i) Data Engineering Steps: 

1. Load the dataset / read csv
2. Check the missing values / filter / clean
3. Insight into the Dataset: Dataset describe
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Data Visualization / Plotting the data
6. Export the output/dataframe 
7. Data Processing -Finding the correlation among features



### (ii) Machine Learning: 

1. Split data into features (X) and target variable (y)
2. Training Model
3. Standard scaler module (Neural Network Modeling)
4. Kmeans algorithm for clusters
5. PCA components for clusters
6. Sub clusters
7. PCA for sub clusters


### (iii) Tableau or HTML Dropdown Menu:
1. Visualizations of machine learning outcomes
2. Presentation stories in Tableau/HTML
