# Machine Learning: Heart Disease Datasets

# Project 4 Proposal: Heart Disease

## Project Description: 

Using heart disease data to segment customers based on demographics and make predictions. We will form clusters based on demographic information and use this to gather valuable insights and make predictions/forecasts. 

### Technologies: python, machine learning, tableau, SQL, pandas

### Database: from Kaggle 

### Question we are interested in: 

[1] 

[2]

[3]

[4]

### Tasks: 

[1] Data Emgineering: cleaning, merging datasets 
[2] Machine Learning: Unsupervised learning, PCA 
[3] Visualizations will be made with Tableau/HTML, having several dashboards and a story.

### Group Members and tasks each will do: 

All members look for datasets, ETL, perform machine learning algorithms once data is prepared  Pandas, data analysis, Tableau, presentation, data analysis

## TECHNICAL STEPS:

### (i) Data Engineering Steps: 

1. Load the dataset / read csv
2. Check the missing values / filter / clean
3. Insight into the Dataset: Dataset describe
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Data Visualization / Plotting the data
6. Export the output/dataframe 
7. Data Processing -Finding the correlation among features
8. Split data into features (X) and target variable (y)


### (ii) Machine Learning: 

1. Training Model
2. Standard scaler module
3. Kmeans algorithm for clusters
4. PCA components for clusters
5. Sub clusters
6. PCA for sub clusters


### (iii) Tableau or HTML Dropdown Menu:
1. Visualizations of machine learning outcomes
2. Presentation stories in Tableau/HTML
